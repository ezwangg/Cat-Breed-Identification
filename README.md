# 🐱 Cat Breed Detection Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## 📌 Project Overview
Cat breed identification is an important task in pet management, veterinary services, and animal welfare systems. However, manual identification is challenging due to subtle differences in facial structure, fur patterns, and physical traits among breeds.

This project proposes a deep learning–based Cat Breed Detection System using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The system is capable of classifying cat breeds from images and is integrated into a mobile application for real-time prediction.
